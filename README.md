#### Readme for MerkleTree Code

The provided code implements a Merkle tree data structure and related functions for constructing the tree, verifying the root hash, generating and verifying proofs, and various helper functions.

### Overview

The code consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Types**
   - `Data`: A type alias for a vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`).
   - `Hash`: A type alias for a vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`).

2. **MerkleTree Struct**
   - Contains a vector of hashes representing the nodes of the Merkle tree.
   - Provides methods for constructing the tree, obtaining the root hash, verifying the root hash, generating proofs, and verifying proofs.

3. **HashDirection Enum**
   - Specifies the side to put the hash on when concatenating proof hashes.

4. **Proof Struct**
   - Contains a vector of tuples representing the hashes to use when verifying the proof.

5. **Utils Module**
   - Contains helper functions for hashing data, concatenating hashes, and other internal operations.

6. **Tests Module**
   - Includes unit tests for the construction of the Merkle tree, verification of the root hash, and generation and verification of proofs.

### Usage

The Merkle tree can be used to construct a tree from input data, verify the root hash, generate proofs, and verify proofs. The provided unit tests demonstrate the usage of the Merkle tree for various scenarios.

### Example Usage

```rust
// Construct a Merkle tree from input data
let data = vec![vec![1, 2, 3], vec![4, 5, 6]];
let tree = MerkleTree::construct(&data);

// Obtain the root hash of the constructed tree
let root_hash = tree.root();

// Generate a proof for a specific data and verify the proof
let proof = tree.prove(&data[0]).unwrap();
let is_valid_proof = MerkleTree::verify_proof(&data[0], &proof, &root_hash);
```

### Testing

The provided unit tests cover the construction of the Merkle tree, verification of the root hash, and generation and verification of proofs for different scenarios.
